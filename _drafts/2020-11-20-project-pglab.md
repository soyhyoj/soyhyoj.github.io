Finally, some cleaning's done on [my very first Jupyter notebooks from 2018-2019](https://github.com/soyhyoj/PGlab). I literally copied & pasted chunks of code from the internet, wove them and ran them like hit-or-miss, because I was not capable of creating a script from scratch back then. But thanks to Python's easy syntax and vast online documentations, I managed to read short lines of codes and get a grasp of what's going on. The codes were only for having a preliminary, instant insight and not for presentative, so it needed some pruning and organization.

## Why programming?

1. Data size
    The data I used to deal with were time-series of neural signals (either electrical outputs or images) recorded over varying time length (minutes to hours). The size of each result (raw data) would easily take up to GBs. The raw files were then exported in CSV format by 

2. integrated work
    To analyze this kind of experimental data, multiple software (and machines) were needed at different stages of the work (collection, retrieval, analysis and visualization). And I had so much trouble back in the lab due to a limited access to the licensed softwares I wanted.

3. Customized analysis -> light

## Why Python?

matlab x
R, Python -> transferrable skills


## Results (examples)



Benefits
With these codes, the time I put into the preliminary analysis was reduced from days to minutes. I could understand the results of the day in real-time and plan the next experiment based on it.
