Finally, some cleaning's done on [my very first Jupyter notebooks from 2018-2019](https://github.com/soyhyoj/PGlab). Back then, I wasn't capable of coding from scratch, so I literally copied & pasted chunks of code from the internet, wove them and ran them by hit-or-miss. But thanks to Python's easy syntax and vast online documentations, I managed to read short codes and get a grasp of what's going on. I needed this Python script only for having a preliminary summary inspection of the day, and not for a presentative purpose, so the only concern was how accurate results are. Now that I became a Python practicioner, it was time to do some pruning and organization on these notebooks.

## Why programming was necessary?

1. Data size
    The data I used to deal with were time-series of neural signals (either electrical outputs or images) recorded over varying time length (minutes to hours) and its size would easily take up to GBs. I often suffered from memory issue when tried analyzing the data with Excel and if not, the analysis using Excel eaily took several days. Moreover, the analysis dragging over hundreds of cells was very error-prone.

2. integrated work
    To analyze this kind of experimental data, multiple software (and machines) were needed at different stages of the work (collection, retrieval, analysis and visualization). And I had so much trouble back in the lab due to a limited access to the licensed softwares I wanted.

3. Customized analysis -> light

## Why Python?

matlab x
R, Python -> transferrable skills


## Results (examples)



Benefits
With these codes, the time I put into the preliminary analysis was reduced from days to minutes. I could understand the results of the day in real-time and plan the next experiment based on it.


## What's next?
I'm following this kind tutorial on [Case Studies in Neural Data Analysis](https://mark-kramer.github.io/Case-Studies-Python/02.html#plotting-the-erp)
