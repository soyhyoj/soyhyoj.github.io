Recently I was asked to justify my choice of leaving outliers -instead of removing them- during a technical interview for a data scientist position. The interview was based on my pre-handed take-home test where I provided a time series forecast related to a specific business case.

Among the numerous questions that I got from two interviewers over a hour, the one about outliers raised me a particular interest. Despite my confidence in the rational built on a substantial EDA, their response was cluing me that they were clearly not happy with the way I dealt with the outliers (in this case, out-of-range values). What did I miss here?
