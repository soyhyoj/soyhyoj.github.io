        <title>Project: Mobile Transaction Fraud Detection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this 2-week project, I aimed to try something completely different from what I practiced in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soyhyoj.github.io/2020/project-research-trend-analysis/&quot;&gt;previous project&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the text data, I got 6M rows of numbers. Rather than wrangling the data for a purely personal curiosity, I built predictive models which can potentially address a practical solution for mobile buisiness to detect frauds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a collaborative project done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mariagaya&quot;&gt;Maria Gay√† Fiol&lt;/a&gt; and myself. The data we selected was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1&quot;&gt;a simulated mobile money transaction log available on the Kaggle website&lt;/a&gt;. Our goal was to understand the features related to fraudulent profit by exploratory data analysis and make good predictions on the unseen data based on our findings. As to enhance prediction performance, we implemented different machine learning algorithms and evaluated each model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/soyhyoj/FraudDetectionPaysim&quot;&gt;this public repo&lt;/a&gt;, only my part of the data analysis and modeling part is available.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project: Research Trend Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscience geek who has recently moved on to the field of data science, it was very clear to me that the first personal analytics project had to be something related to my dear past experience of being a neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/&quot;&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly peer-reviewed journal published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfn.org/&quot;&gt;the Society for Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, is probably the journal which I (like any other scientists working in this domain) have read the most while designing, developing and concluding experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2-week sprint project was a perfect opportunity for me to leverage common NLP techniques in order to find an answer to my question:
Were the rising topics that I read as trends result of my attentional bias or was there a real fuss about them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Objective
From the beginning, this project was meant to be a data cleaning-oriented since it is one of my favorite works in data analytics. 

### Data mining
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the most important web archive for biomedical and life sciences journal literature, provides APIs to 
a library called [PyMed](https://github.com/PyMed/PyMed).

### Data cleaning


### Result --&gt;
