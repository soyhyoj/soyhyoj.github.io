        <title>Project: Research Trend Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscience geek who has recently moved on to the field of data science, it was very clear to me that the first personal analytics project had to be something related to my dear past experience of being a neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jneurosci.org/&quot;&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly peer-reviewed journal published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfn.org/&quot;&gt;the Society for Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, is probably the journal which I (like any other scientists working in this domain) have read the most while designing, developing and concluding experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2-week sprint project was a perfect opportunity for me to leverage common NLP techniques in order to find an answer to my question:
Were the rising topics that I read as trends result of my attentional bias or was there a real fuss about them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Objective
From the beginning, this project was meant to be a data cleaning-oriented since it is one of my favorite works in data analytics. 

### Data mining
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the most important web archive for biomedical and life sciences journal literature, provides APIs to 
a library called [PyMed](https://github.com/PyMed/PyMed).

### Data cleaning


### Result --&gt;
